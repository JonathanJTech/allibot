# allibot
Allibot is a chatbot for Discord, built using OpenAI's GPT-4.1-mini. Prompts are go in /events/allibot-prompts (not included with this repository).

Also requires several other `.json` files to run, including a config file containing an OpenAI key, the bot's token on Discord, and the Discord account ID of the "owner" (me).

To install package dependencies, run `npm install`.

To start the bot, run `npm start`.
